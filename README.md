This is an example that shows how to support rendering per-instance motion
vectors within *indirect instanced drawing* of Unity.

(In this document, the term *"indirect instanced drawing"* refers to drawing
instanced geometries with using the indirect drawing API -- specifically using
[Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect].)

System requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2017.2 or later

This example uses [BuiltinRenderTextureType.MotionVectors] that is newly
introduce in Unity 2017.2, so that it only runs on 2017.2 or later versions.

How to support motion vectors within indirect instanced drawing
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Write the `MotionVectors` light mode pass for the custom shader. It's
  recommended to use the first pass of the subshader to make it easy to refer
  from command buffers. ⇒ [Example][Example1]

- Implement the `OnRenderObject` method and manually invoke the `MotionVectors`
  pass with using a command buffer. [BuiltinRenderTextureType.MotionVectors]
  can be used to set the motion vectors texture as a render target. ⇒ 
  [Example][Example2]
